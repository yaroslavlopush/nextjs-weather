### Weather Forecast Widget

The candidate is tasked with creating a weather forecast widget using ReactJS, targeting modern
web browsers. The application must fetch and display real-time weather data for a specified city using
the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api), including temperature, humidity, and general weather conditions. Users
should be able to input or select a city, toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit, and view a
user-friendly interface that also handles error states effectively. While the core functionality
revolves around a single-screen layout featuring a city input field and a weather
widget, bonus points are awarded for additional features such as a 5-day forecast, a visually
appealing design with smooth transitions and animations, and robust error handling for edge cases
and connectivity issues. The project should emphasize clean, modular code, a clear separation of UI
and business logic, and the use of modern React Native methodologies. The provided Figma assets serve
as a design reference and are not required for replication. Upon completion, the candidate is expected
to publish the code in a public repository and can earn recognition for an innovative and responsive
user interface.
